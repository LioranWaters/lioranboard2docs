Wait commands temporarily pause the execution of a button and wait until a specific action is completed to continue with the rest of the commands.\
To prevent the button from being paused indefinitely, you must set up a timeout for all wait commands after which the button execution unpauses even if the action did not complete.\
Wait commands are similar to async/await in JavaScript.
