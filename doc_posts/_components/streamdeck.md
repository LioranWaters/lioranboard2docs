### PC Version
Desktop version of Stream Deck can be found at `lioranboard/Stream deck` folder. You can also open it by pressing Stream Deck button in the main menu in LioranBoard.\
Once launched, you will see connection settings. Default IP address for Lioranboard is always `127.0.0.1` and port is always `9425`. Unless you changed port in your LioranBoard-settings, you can leave it at its default value.\
**You must fill out the password if you decided to use one in LioranBoard-Settings menu.**\
Note that you only need to do this once, as your Stream Deck will remember the previous settings.
