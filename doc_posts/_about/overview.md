LioranBoard 2 is a closed source app made in GameMaker Studio 2 which has become one of the most popular and customizable OBS Stream Decks.\
The main application (LioranBoard) was developed in 09/2019 in GameMaker Studio 1 by Lioran, but it was very different from LioranBoard 2 that we know now.

      <q>LioranBoard was never planned. It was just a bunch of code for myself that triggered sound effect based on numpad presses.</q>

Lioran started adding more features and commands every update, essentially inventing his own programming language and making LioranBoard user friendly and available for everyone to benefit from.   


LioranBoard 2 development started in summer 2021. Lioran recreated it mainly from scratch using Gamemaker Studio 2, which was a significant upgrade from its predecessor. The UI was completely reworked and many functions and commands were added that were not possible in GMS 1.
