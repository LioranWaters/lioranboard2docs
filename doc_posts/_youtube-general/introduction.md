YouTube Live is a completely new and free LioranBoard integration made by [Christina K](https://github.com/christinna9031?tab=repositories) and later reworked for LioranBoard 2 by Lioran himself.\
It allows you to listen to all chat events, send chat messages, ban users and other commands straight from LioranBoard while streaming on YouTube Live.  

Unlike Twitch, YouTube API is very limited and cannot be freely used without going through a long approval process. It has taken several months for YouTube to approve the integration and provide me with additional quota to be able to release it for everyone.

Please consider [donating](https://lioranboard.ca/donate) or supporting me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Christinna?fan_landing=true), so I can keep further developing and maintaining the integration. Thank you!
