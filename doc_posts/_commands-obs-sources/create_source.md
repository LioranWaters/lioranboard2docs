Creates a new source and adds it to a scene.\
You can pass a JSON string containing the new source's settings as well.\
The source will be added at the top of the list. To reorder it, use a Custom Packet command to send a JSON string containing the new order of all sources in your scene: {% include selectAll.html text='<code>{"request-type":"ReorderSceneItems","scene":"YOURSCENENAME","items":[{"name":"YOURSOURCENAME1"},{"name":"YOURSOURCENAME2"},{"name":"YOURSOURCENAME3"},{"name":"YOURSOURCENAME4"}(etc.)],"message-id":"6666"}</code>' %}`.

{% include alert.html text="If you want to add the newly created source into a group, you must do so manually." type="warning" %}
