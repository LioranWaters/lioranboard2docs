**Outdated Stream Deck**\
Make sure you're using the latest version of Stream Deck. 

**Wrong IP/port**\
If you press 'Connect' in your StreamDeck and nothing happens (you only see the progress icon), it means it hasn't established a successful connection to LioranBoard. The reason can be a wrong IP address/port, VPN or something else blocking the port.

**Wrong or corrupted deck files**\
Sometimes Stream Deck files can get corrupted and start crashing Stream Deck on launch. Deleting and downloading a new Stream Deck will not help, as its files are stored in your AppData folder.

1. Completely close your Stream Deck.
2. Navigate to `C:/user/%username/appdata/local/LioranBoard_Stream_Deck`
3. Delete everything in the folder. Don't worry, these are only your deck data and your Stream Deck will automatically generate them again!
4. Relaunch your Stream Deck.
